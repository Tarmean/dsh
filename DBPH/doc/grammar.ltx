All regular scalar functions are supported (e.g. | + |, | - |, | && |, etc). Furthermore the
following functions are supported:
\begin{itemize}
    \item |e.i| projection on tuples
    \item |e1[e2]| element lookup on lists, e2 should evaluate to an int
    \item |length|
%    \item |range e1 e2| results in a list |[e1 ... e2]|
    \item |restrict| takes two vectors and filters from the first all the element at a false position in the second
    \item |combine|
    \item |dist| works on vectors!
    \item |bPermute| 
\end{itemize}
