-- Relation between interactivity and rating
-- 
-- For instance, when readers rate a thread positively, they could do it because
-- of the topic (itâ€™s a fascinating or important topic), but they could also do
-- it because of the quality of the discussion itself. A potential marker of a
-- good discussion quality is the interactivity. Thus, the first step of the
-- query should compute an interactivity variable for each thread, defined as the
-- percentage of posts in the thread that contain quotes.
-- 
-- To get this, one would have to check for each post [spiegelPostUrl] in a given
-- thread [spiegelPostThreadUrl] whether it contains a quote
-- [spiegelQuotePostUrl] or not (coded binary), sum up the binary values over the
-- entire thread, and divide it by the number of posts in the thread
-- [spiegelThreadReplies]. The interactivity variable would be named
-- [spiegelThreadInteractivity] and saved as new variable in the thread database.
-- 
-- For the analysis of this research question we would further have to
-- exclude all threads that did not receive a rating [spiegelThreadRating].
-- 
-- Finally, we would need a Pearson correlation coefficient (plus significance).
-- This would allow us to see whether interactivity [spiegelThreadInteractivity]
-- is positively correlated with the average rating of the thread
-- [spiegelThreadRating].
